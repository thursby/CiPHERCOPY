High-performance file copy & verification toolkit providing:

* A multi-threaded command-line interface (CLI) with live ANSI progress bars.
* A cross‑platform Flutter graphical user interface (GUI) with a step‑by‑step wizard, rich progress, cancellation, and log interactions.
* A reusable core library (`ciphercopy_core`) exposing copy & verify primitives, progress events, and cooperative cancellation.

---

## GUI (Flutter Application)

The GUI lives in `app/` and offers an accessible wizard-style workflow for both Copy and Verify operations without remembering flags.

### GUI Features
* Three-step wizard: Operation -> Configure -> Progress.
* Copy mode: select a plain text list of source file paths and a destination directory.
* Verify mode: select an existing `hashes.sha1` manifest generated by a previous copy.
* Optional toggle to also write `copied.txt` & `errored.txt` (equivalent to CLI `-l`).
* Live overall progress plus per-file progress bars (only active files shown to reduce churn).
* Structured logging: path is displayed; click to open, copy the path, or reveal in Finder (macOS) / system file manager.
* Immediate log flushing after each record for real-time visibility.
* Cancellation: cooperative; in‑flight work stops gracefully, partial outputs (hash log, copied list, etc.) are preserved.
* Reset button to return to the initial wizard state after completion or cancellation.
* SnackBar error surfacing (e.g. invalid / empty manifest).
* macOS entitlements configured for user‑selected read/write access (file dialogs powered by `file_selector`).

### Running the GUI
Prerequisites: Flutter SDK (3.9+ compatible with the Dart constraint) installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/thursby/ciphercopy.git
cd ciphercopy/app
flutter pub get
flutter run   # choose a desktop target (macOS recommended) or Chrome
```

### Using the GUI
1. Select operation (Copy or Verify).
2. Provide required inputs:
   * Copy: list file + destination directory.
   * Verify: `.sha1` manifest file.
   * (Optional) Enable “Save copied / errored file lists”.
3. Start and watch progress. You can cancel at any time; completed files remain logged.
4. When finished, open or reveal the log from the status area, or reset to start a new run.

### GUI Outputs
Outputs mirror the CLI (see below) and are produced via the shared core. The log file is also copied alongside the destination (copy) or manifest (verify) for convenience.

### Cancellation Semantics
On cancellation the core stops spawning new worker isolates and signals existing ones. Already finished files remain in the SHA-1 manifest and copied list; incomplete files are excluded. This allows partial auditing or resumption logic in future enhancements.

## CLI

High-performance, multi-threaded file copier for large batches with live per-file progress bars and SHA-1 verification.

It reads a plain text list of file paths, copies them to a destination directory while preserving relative paths, and writes a combined SHA-1 file for verification. Concurrency uses Dart isolates for parallel I/O.

### Features

* Streamed copy for large files
* Parallelism via isolates (configurable threads)
* Live per-file progress bars + overall progress
* Combined SHA-1 output file in the destination
* Optional copied.txt and errored.txt manifests
* Structured logging to a timestamped log file (also copied to the destination)
* Verify mode to validate files against a previously generated `.sha1` manifest
* Cooperative cancellation (shared implementation with GUI)

### Requirements
* Dart SDK 3.9+

### Installation

Clone and get dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thursby/ciphercopy.git
cd ciphercopy/cli
dart pub get
```

Optional: build a native executable:

```sh
dart compile exe bin/ciphercopy_cli.dart -o ciphercopy
```

### Usage

Run with a list file and a destination directory:

```sh
dart run bin/ciphercopy_cli.dart <list_file> <destination_directory>
```

Flags:

* `-h, --help` Show usage
* `-t, --threads <count>` Number of concurrent threads (defaults to CPU cores)
* `-l, --list` Also write `copied.txt` and `errored.txt` in the destination
* `--verify <hashes.sha1>` Verify instead of copy (omit list & destination args)

Examples:

```sh
# Basic
dart run bin/ciphercopy_cli.dart ~/Downloads/list.txt ~/Downloads/dest

# Limit concurrency
dart run bin/ciphercopy_cli.dart -t 4 ~/Downloads/list.txt ~/Downloads/dest

# Also emit copied.txt and errored.txt
dart run bin/ciphercopy_cli.dart -l ~/Downloads/list.txt ~/Downloads/dest

# Verify using defaults (threads = CPU cores)
dart run bin/ciphercopy_cli.dart --verify ~/Downloads/dest/hashes.sha1
```

### Verify files using a .sha1 manifest

Use `--verify` with the path to a `hashes.sha1` file produced by this app. The verification runs multi-threaded and shows the same per-file + overall progress bars.

```sh
# Limit concurrency during verify
dart run bin/ciphercopy_cli.dart --verify -t 4 ~/Downloads/dest/hashes.sha1
```

Output summary example:

```
Overall: ████████████████████████████  135/135 100.0%
Verify complete: 135/135 OK, 0 mismatched, 0 errors.
```

### List file format

* Plain text; one path per line
* Empty lines are ignored
* Directory entries are skipped
* Absolute or relative paths are accepted

Paths are preserved under the destination. If a path starts with `/`, the leading slash is removed to keep a relative layout under the destination.

Example `list.txt`:

```
/Users/alex/projects/a/big.iso
./assets/images/logo.png
relative/path/to/file.txt
```

### Library Usage (Core)

Both the CLI and GUI depend on the shared library in `core/`.

Add to your own `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ciphercopy_core: ^1.0.0   # (When published) – currently path-based inside this mono-repo
```

Import and use:

```dart
import 'package:ciphercopy_core/ciphercopy_core.dart';

// Copy
await copyFilesFromList(listPath, destinationDir,
    threadCount: 8,
    saveLists: true,
    cancelToken: token,
    onProgress: (e) { /* update UI */ });

// Verify
final summary = await verifyFromSha1('dest/hashes.sha1',
    threadCount: 8,
    cancelToken: token,
    onProgress: (e) { /* update UI */ });
```

Progress is streamed via `ProgressEvent` objects (file start, chunk progress, file done, overall counters). `CancellationToken` enables cooperative cancellation.

### Outputs

In the destination directory (copy mode):

* `hashes.sha1` Combined SHA-1 list in the format: `<sha1>  <absolute-dest-file-path>`
* `copied.txt` (with `-l`) All copied file paths
* `errored.txt` (with `-l`) Any files that failed to copy

Logging:

* A log file is created in the project working directory, e.g. `copy-<dest-name>-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-SS.log`
* In copy mode, the log is copied into the destination directory at the end
* In verify mode, the log is copied alongside the `.sha1` manifest

### CLI Progress UI

* Per-file bars show the file name, bytes copied, and percent
* An Overall bar is always shown at the bottom and increments when files complete
* Updates use ANSI control codes; if your terminal doesn’t support them, output may not render correctly

### Exit codes

* `0` Success
* `64` Usage error (missing/invalid arguments)
* `2` Runtime error (copy or hash failures encountered)

### How it works (brief)

* Main isolate reads the list, prepares destination paths, and spawns up to N worker isolates
* Each worker streams a source file to the destination, reports periodic progress, and computes the SHA-1 while copying
* The main isolate writes the combined `hashes.sha1`, maintains progress bars, and optionally writes copied/errored manifests
* In verify mode, workers compute SHA-1 for each file listed in the manifest and compare against the expected hash; progress is reported the same way

### Troubleshooting

* “Permission denied”: ensure read access to sources and write permissions to the destination
* “No such file or directory”: verify paths in your list file exist
* Slow copies: try reducing `--threads` if I/O is saturated, or increasing it on fast storage
* Progress garbled: use a terminal with ANSI support and sufficient width

### Features To Do
* Sign hash manifest with HMAC
* Copy directories (not just file lists)
* Resume interrupted copies
* Configurable hash algorithms (e.g., SHA-256, MD5)
* Exclude/include patterns for file selection
* Cross-platform support improvements (Windows, Linux, GUI polish)
* Configurable logging verbosity
